# ML-Game-Experiments
Creating simple games and then creating and implementing ML models to play them.

Models will be based off the [Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf)

## Plan
### Game 1:
1. Create game using pygame.
2. Create OpenAI Gym enviroment for game.
3. Create ML model for playing game.
4. Train/tune model.
### Game 2:
To be determined.
